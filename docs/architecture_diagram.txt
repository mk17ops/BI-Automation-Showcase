# Decision Support System Architecture

A decision support system consists of several layers that work together to provide accurate and relevant information to decision-makers:

- **Data Source**: Data from operational systems, Excel files, SQL Server databases, etc.
- **ETL Process**: Extract, Transform, and Load the data into the Data Warehouse.
- **Data Warehouse**: Centralized storage of integrated and cleansed data.
- **Data Marts**: Subsets of the Data Warehouse, specific to a particular domain such as finance or insurance.
- **BI Tools**: Power BI, for data visualization and analysis.
- **End Users**: Decision-makers and analysts who use reports and dashboards to make informed decisions.

## 2.5 Conceptual Schema of the Data Warehouse

### CIMA Design Schema

The CIMA design schema uses a **fact constellation**, where multiple fact tables share common dimensions. This approach enables the modeling of complex relationships between different fact tables, facilitating cross-fact analysis.

### Finance Design Schema

The Finance design schema uses a **star schema**, with a central fact table connected to several dimension tables. This structure simplifies queries and optimizes performance for analysis.
